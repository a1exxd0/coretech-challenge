# Goals for the challenge
Most of all for me this is a learning experience. I'll be testing this for Ubuntu only, and will try make it as rigorous a project as possible. This means trying to stick to proper modern C++ consistently, as well as looking to employ multithreading and externam libraries where appropriate.
